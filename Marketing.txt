As A 3D modeler and animator, I use Make Human for creating 3D character models. Make human is a free 3D character modeling software supported by its huge fans (community). Assets provided with software are very few. So, community creates different assets for 3d characters to bring variation. The problem is, these assets are not few that one can download. Moreover, I need all of the assets for bad time. Visiting link individualy and downloading all assets is not easy for me. So I created a scrapper for downloading all the assets from site at once. It creates folders with asset name, and throws all the asset files in that folder that I can reuse later. I Hope you will like this script and use it if your are a 3d Modeler Too.
