Make a Folder With Asset name like for clothes "clothes" With different scrappers I provided.
Make sure python.exe, that asset folder and scrapper scrips will be in the same place.
Open CMD at same place. And then type: python.exe <your script name>
Leave the rest on script.

Kind Note:
MHDD.py is dynamic file for downloading content.
You have to change following parameters at top of script to run perfectly;

mainpage_url = "custom" (this is what comes after in url for asset like in this link; "http://makehumancommunity.org/targets.html" url has targets.html so you have to put what is before html.


child_page_url = "content" (When you open suppose targets.html you see the list of contents having title, category etc. Hover over a link you see the child page url suppose for targets.html, one of the content link like Elf Series: ears has download url like http://makehumancommunity.org/target/elf_series_ears.html , so you put what comes after .org/ and before the content name/ in above example it is target)

model_folder = "customcontent" (This is folder where you throw all assets, you have to created that folder manually.)

number_of_pages = 1 (Number of pages that assets have, like for targets.html, the content pages are 6. So you have to put 6 in there)


Also you have to change the condition:
if ".zip" in str(link.get('href'))  or ".blend" in str(link.get('href')) and not "windows.zip" in str(link.get('href')):

To what ever you like, For example the targets content contains content with file name ".target" so you change above url to
if ".target" in str(link.get('href')):


I hope you will like this effor.
